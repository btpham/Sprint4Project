#Sprint4Project 
# This project is to support learning for Software Development Tool, Practicum's Sprint 4.

# https://sp4project.onrender.com - not sure if the link will work, when done locally, the content is fine. I keep getting a failed deployment in Render.
# This happened while I was doing the coursework as well. Dimitry Donetskov tried multiple times and it finally worked for him. He explained there might
# have been an issue in Render which was eventually fixed. I was able to deploy as well, after he succeeded.
# Please use this link for access to the video showing how this work looks in streamlit:
